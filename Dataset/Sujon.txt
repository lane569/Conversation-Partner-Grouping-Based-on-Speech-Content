Oh my god! That car just gone through that red light and hit another car!

I don’t know I'm going to call 999. Hello? I would like to report a car accident

It looks like a woman is hurt.


It has just happened right now.The accident happened opposite the Tesco supermarket on Luke Street.

OK, thanks. Bye.

They’re are sending an ambulance, fire engine and a police car within the next 5 minutes.

Yes, I hope so too. You have to be very careful at all times when you’re driving.
